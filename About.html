        <h2>WHAT IS UNICEF</h2>
        <p>UNICEF is the world’s farthest-reaching humanitarian organization for children. Across 190 countries and territories, and in the world’s toughest places, we work day in and day out to help children survive. To defend their rights. To keep them protected, healthy and educated. To give them a fair chance to fulfil their potential.</p>
        <h2>UNICEF MISSION</h2>
        <p id="main-moto">Our mission is to mobilize and empower Canadians to invest in the positive transformation of every child’s future.</p>
        <p>UNICEF stands for every child, everywhere. We are guided by the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, advocating for the protection of children’s rights, helping to meet their basic needs, and giving them a fair chance to reach their full potential.</p>
        <p>Undaunted by war, disaster, disease or distance, UNICEF staff work day in and day out to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children with healthcare and vaccines, nutrition, clean water and sanitation, protection, quality education, emergency relief and more.</p>
        <p>UNICEF is on the ground before, during and long after humanitarian emergencies, leading international response in water and sanitation, nutrition, education and child protection. Our global supply chain and local presence mean we can rapidly send help, even before it’s needed.</p>
        <p>As part of the UN family, our ability to work neutrally with governments, the private sector and civil society generates results for children on a scale that is unparalleled. UNICEF even has the influence to pause hostilities in conflict zones – ceasefires known as ‘Days of Tranquility’ – so that children can receive medical care.</p>
        <p>Donor support helps reach 45% of the world’s children under age 5 with vaccines, and create long-term solutions that address maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health; child marriage; girls’ access to education; HIV prevention; ending violence against children; child trafficking and exploitation.</p>

        <h2>WHAT DOES THE NAME 'UNICEF' STAND FOR?</h2>
        <p>UNICEF is the short form of “United Nations Children’s Fund.”</p>
        <p>UNICEF was the world’s first international organization for children, established by the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1946. Until 1953, our name was an acronym for “United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund”, because UNICEF’s very first mandate was to meet the urgent needs of children after World War II. </p>
        <p>In 1953, UNICEF became a permanent part of the UN family of organizations, broadening its mandate to address the long-term needs of children around the world. Although the words “International” and “Emergency” were no longer in our official name, ‘UNICEF’ was retained as an acronym.</p>
        <p>Our mission has always been for children first – regardless of race, religion or politics – and has always relied on voluntary contributions.</p>

        <h2>UNICEF IN THE FIELD</h2>
        <P>Most UNICEF staff work in the field, across 190 countries and territories. Field staff deliver life-saving supplies and medical care. They feed, comfort and educate children – even in dangerous conflict zones. They are the heart and soul of UNICEF, ensuring your generosity makes a life-changing difference, and that the Plumpy’Nut® or vaccine packs you donated will reach the children who need them most.</P>
